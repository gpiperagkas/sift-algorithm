# sift-algorithm
An implementation of the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) computer vision algorithm 
for feature extraction/color descriptor of images using OpenCV library. 

Based on the article: 
Lowe, David G. "Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints." 
International journal of computer vision 60.2 (2004): 91-110.

Use with ten sample external images. 

The algorithm has been tested with benchmarking data.
